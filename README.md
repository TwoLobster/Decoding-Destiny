This is a Java project based on astrology which details how Java concepts can be utilised to create an application that will generate predictions about your future and present based on Astrological sciences. 
It was made by me and two other friends (Pratik and Tilak) as a collaborative effort for our Semester long assignment during second semester under the guidance of our Java professor, Kapil Gupta.
We used two different APIs, one to receive the planet positions and the other to recieve the latitude and Longitude of the place entered by the person. 
It can only generate the predictions for places located in India.
